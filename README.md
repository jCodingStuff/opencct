# opencct

The **Open Call Center Toolkit** (`opencct`) is a Rust library for **simulating call centers** and **optimizing staffing**.
It supports multiple call types, multi-skilled agents, and service level agreements (SLAs).

> ⚠️ **Note:** This library is under development. APIs may change.

## Features (planned)

- Simulate multi-call-type, multi-agent call centers
- Optimize staffing based on SLAs and expected call volumes
- Provide Python bindings for usage via **PyPI** and **Conda**
- Flexible, Rust-native API for integration in other projects

## Installation

Currently in development. Once ready, it will be installable via:

```bash
# Rust
cargo add opencct

# Python (future)
pip install opencct
```
